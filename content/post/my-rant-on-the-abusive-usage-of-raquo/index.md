More and more, I see people using the right angle quotation mark (&raquo;, <code>&amp;raquo;</code>) in navigational elements on websites. The right angle quotation mark as well as it's symmetrical sister are semantical elements designed to convey grammatical information: in many languages, such as French or Spanish, they are exactly what their name says they are:  quotation marks. Using the glyph that represents them as a symbolic element, a substitue for an arrow of sorts, deforms this meaning, is semantically incorrect, and infuriates me very much. 


There is no shortage of arrow symbols in unicode ([as shown on this page](http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_arrows.html)), so using the double angle brackets as a substitute for an arrow is nothing short of laziness. You can start with the right arrow (&rarr;, <code>&amp;rarr;</code>).


Ignoring the semantic correctness (and I can't believe I'm writing this) we encounter another problem: accessibility. Many screen readers will read out these characters, which is even more confusing because the *name* of raquo (often read as "right double angle bracket") does not *sound* like an arrow, unlike the right arrow mentioned above, which is read as "right arrow" : much more explicit.
